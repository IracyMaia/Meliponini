**Why do this project?**


Stingless bees (Meliponini tribe) play an important role in pollinating natural ecosystems and agricultural crops in the Legal Amazon, where 182 species of these bees exist. However, deforestation in the region is compromising the biodiversity of these bees and their ecosystem services. Distribution models are useful tools to assess the effects of deforestation and climate change, and despite limitations in records and collections, recent studies estimate a possible reduction of 95% of meliponine species in the Caraj√°s National Forest in the coming years. Protected areas such as conservation units, indigenous lands, and quilombola areas are important for maintaining biodiversity and sustainable development in the region.

**What is the purpose of the project?**

Evaluate the relationship between the diversity of stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini) providing or not the ecosystem service of crop pollination with soil use and protected areas in the Legal Amazon.
